### What is a scripting language?

- A **scripting language** is a type of programming language that is interpreted rather than compiled. It is typically used to **automate tasks**, **control software applications**, or **glue together components** of a system.
- Scripts are often written to be executed by an **interpreter**, which reads and executes the code line-by-line at runtime, rather than being compiled into machine code beforehand.

### Key Characteristics of Scripting Languages

- **Interpreted, not compiled**

  Scripting languages are usually interpreted, meaning the code is executed directly without a separate compilation step.

- **High-level and easy to use**

  They are designed to be simple and expressive, allowing developers to write code quickly and with fewer lines.

### Key Characteristics of Scripting Languages

- **Automation-focused**

  Scripting languages are often used to automate repetitive tasks, such as file manipulation, system administration, or web scraping.

- **Integration with other systems**

  They are commonly used to integrate and communicate with other programs, APIs, or system components.

### Key Characteristics of Scripting Languages

- **Rapid development and prototyping**

  Scripting languages support fast development cycles, making them ideal for prototyping and small-scale applications.

### Examples of Scripting Languages

- **Python**: Web development, automation, data science
- **JavaScript**: Web development (client and server-side)
- **Bash**: Shell scripting, system administration, DevOps tasks
- **Powershell**: Windows automation, DevOps tasks

### Real-world uses for scripting language

- Real-life systems are made up of multiple programs all working together. Scripts can be used to help each separate program work together.
- Different scripting languages have different capabilities. For example, you might use PHP to manage cookies and manipulate databases. Or you might use Ruby to write code for web applications designed to run on specific operating systems.
