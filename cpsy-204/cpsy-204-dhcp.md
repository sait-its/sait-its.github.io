### ARP - What is it?

- We need to review how computers communicate on a network before we can talk about DHCP.
- Computer to computer communication is done at the physical level
  - Uses unique Hardware address (MAC address; Media Access Control)
- IP address is logical addressing
  - Especially useful for internetworking and routing

### What Does TCP/IP Provide?

- Open protocol standards
- Independence from specific **physical** network hardware
- A globally unique addressing scheme
- Support for internetworking and routing
- Standardized high-level protocols for consistent, widely available user services

### OSI and TCP/IP Model

### Now Addresses are Needed

- **Physical Address** (**ex: Hardware Address**)
  - The reference name of the network interface card
  - Is specific to the architecture
- **Logical Address** (**ex: IP Address**)
  - The address of the device within the entire connected network
  - IP address is specific to the transport layer protocol
